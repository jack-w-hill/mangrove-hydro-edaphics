**Data**

The mangrove survey data included in this repository were produced by Jack W Hill, Lachlan A Bourke and Ciara M Horton. All data is available as a .csv file under the "data" subdirectory. These data are made freely available for further research, but we request that the publication attached to this repository be cited as the source of these values if some or all of them are used:

<em>Hill JW, Bourke LA, Horton CM, Staples TL and Lovelock CE (2021). Limited relationships between mangrove forest structure and hydro-edaphic conditions in subtropical Queensland, Australia.</em> Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science<em> 248: [106930](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecss.2020.106930 "Limited relationships between mangrove forest structure and hydro-edaphic conditions in subtropical Queensland, Australia").</em>

Details of field sampling protocols are included in the publication. Field surveys were supported by The University of Queenslandâ€™s Summer Research Program (Faculty of Science, 2018/19). We  wish to recognise the Traditional Owners of the lands on which these data were collected and to acknowledge their Elders past, present, and emerging.

**R script**

This repository includes a script written by Timothy L Staples, showing our full data analysis pathway and producing all results and figures. It makes use of files in the "data" and "functions" subdirectories; point your working directory to the location of this script and download all other directories from the repository.
